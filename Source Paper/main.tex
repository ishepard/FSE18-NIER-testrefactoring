\begin{abstract}
As part of their programming activity, developers write and maintain test code continuously. Previous research showed that
tests evolve as much as production code, and that refactoring test code is an important practice to keep the code flexible and
bring it in the simple state possible. 
This paper provides an even further analysis of how test code is refactored and how it is related to the maintainability of the production code. Our results show that \emph{Rename Method}, \emph{Move Class} and \emph{Rename Class} are among the most used types of refactoring applied on test code. Furthermore, if we consider the relation between test and production code maintainability, we have that the majority of test-production class pairs are in the low risk category, and that production classes with higher risk are tested by simpler tests.
